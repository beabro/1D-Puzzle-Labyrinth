This project uses the dtekv toolchain to run code on the DTEK-V board, it is made to run with the process the labs used in the course.

On linux:

Compile the code: use the "make" command in the game folder "game_files".

Make sure the jtag connection is active with TODO

Run the code: from the "dtekv-tools" folder, use the following command:
	./dtekv-run ../game_files/main.bin

Enjoy :)
